Project Overview:-
ToyCraft Tales is a data analytics and visualization project that explores sales data from the toy manufacturing industry. The goal is to uncover insights related to market trends, seasonal product performance, and consumer preferences across various U.S. regions.

By using MySQL for structured data storage and Tableau for interactive dashboards and storytelling, this project enables toy manufacturers and analysts to make data-driven decisions. The final visualizations include multiple charts, dashboards, and a 4-scene Tableau story published via Tableau Public.

This project was developed as part of an academic internship and demonstrates how data can drive smarter business strategies in the toy manufacturing sector.
